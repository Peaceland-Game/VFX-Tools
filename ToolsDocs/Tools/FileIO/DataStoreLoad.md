Using the [[FileIO]] system this tool allows us to read and write data in a human legible form. On the script there is a sample to structure storing and loading but [[FileIO]] does not require this specific object to operate with. This is a convivence tool that can help us read data quickly. 

It is recommended to have you own storing method in a different class specific to the bundle you are storing for but that this tool can be used to read individual variables from a bundle if the whole of the structure is not needed.
