![[ToolsShaderPropertyEdit.mp4]]

Allows for the quick randomization of parameters of the shader given to it which can then be applied to given materials. In the example above we have the tool load the [[GoopyGem]] shader and we have defined random ranges for it to generate from. 

When reading from the the shader it will convert parameters into ranges. The following transformation are as follows.

| Original | Conversion   |
| -------- | ------------ |
| Color    | Gradient     |
| Vector   | Two Vector4s |
| Float    | Vector2      |
| Range    | Vector2      |
| Texture  | Texture      |
| Int      | IntVector2   |

## InterpolateProperties (AKA Shader Shifting)

This is a functionality that allows us to interpolate two different ShaderProperties and then apply them to a given material. Goes through parameters of both properties and interpolates them in their own type based on t-lerp value. 

This is an important feature used by [[CharacterVisualController]] which lets us change emotional patterns from one preset to another smoothly.

| Load Properties Blueprint  | Create necessary data structures that allow data to be sent to materials. This data commonly gets refreshed due to Unity so it may occasional resets when moving between scenes or re-opening the project                              |     |
| Override Properties Ranges | Converts all of the blueprint's parameters into ranges and fills out the Properties Ranges object. The range values are set to default values so if Properties Ranges already has ranges in it they will be overridden with new values |     |
| Generate Random Properties | For each range chooses a random value for a given parameter of a material and creates a ShaderProperties object that matches with the blueprint                                                                                        |     |
| Load into Target Materials | Load all generated ShaderProperties into the materials list. Each index of the generated properties matches up with the materials list so order of both lists matter.                                                                  |     |
