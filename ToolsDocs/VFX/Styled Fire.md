![[VFXFireStyled.mp4]]

This is effect uses a fire shader with voronoi noise and a smoke shader behind it. The [[FireBase]] shader is used for the flames with it being used on each particle created by the vfx graph and [[Smoke]] used for the halo. It also uses the [[BillboardLogic]] for the smoke which activates during play and not in editor currently. 

This is a quick fire asset that can used to represent a campfire but is more importantly something to be used as a base and reference for other fires.
