![[VFXMemory.mp4]]

This is used to represent the accessible memories within the hub area. Goes between two modes, a close and far mode. Getting near creates lines of particles which should coordinate with the memory being clickable. When farther more subtle particles will float about the memory. 

The halo affect blends based on distance with more brightness the farther you are and it dimming as you get closer. A scrip attached to the halo lets you control these ranges and intensities. 

Both the particles parent and the glow cloud use [[BillboardLogic]].
